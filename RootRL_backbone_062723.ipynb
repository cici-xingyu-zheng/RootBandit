    "In this code, the PlantRootAgent class represents our reinforcement learning agent (plant root). It initializes a Q-table to store the action-value estimates for each state-action pair. The agent chooses actions based on an exploration-exploitation trade-off, updating the Q-table based on observed rewards and transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to implement the reset_environment and take_action methods according to your specific simulation of the plant root and the soil environment. The reset_environment method should reset the environment to its initial state and return that state. The take_action method simulates the agent taking an action in the environment and returns the next state, reward, and whether the episode is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the number of states, actions, learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate according to your specific problem. Additionally, you may want to consider defining a termination condition for training, such as reaching a certain number of episodes or achieving a desired level of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this code provides a basic framework for reinforcement learning. You'll need to fill in the details specific to your plant root and nutrient foraging scenario."
